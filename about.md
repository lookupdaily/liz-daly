description: I'm Liz, a frontend developer based in London. I have recently taught myself to code and like to spend my time perfecting user experience and accessibility.

My background is in the creative industry, as a marketeer for arts and design events. Increasingly, our events were reliant on our digital platforms, which is where I was able to hone my interest in web development.

I have worked with brilliant web development teams to create and refine event websites such as [Clerkenwell Design Week](https://www.clerkenwelldesignweek.com/), [100% Design](https://www.designlondon.co.uk/) and [Design Shanghai](https://www.designshanghai.com/)â€”working across a range of content management systems. Now I have embarked on a new challenge as a software developer, where I am using some of my experience to build engaging, user friendly products myself.

## Work

After completing a software engineering course at Makers Academy, I have been working as a frontend developer at [Cognizant](https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/services/digital-experience). I am currently contributing to Network Rail's transformative [Intelligent Infrastructure](https://www.networkrail.co.uk/running-the-railway/intelligent-infrastructure/) programme, which is using data to help railway maintenance become proactive rather than reactive. 

I have been building applications and web components in Angular and React, and love writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript. I am an active champion for prioritising accessibility and usability in our solutions.
