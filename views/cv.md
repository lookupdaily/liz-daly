## Tech skills
I am a quick learner of languages and frameworks. I believe that simple, well-documented and maintainable code is more important than language specialism.

  <dt>Collaborator</dt>
  <dd>
    I am at my happiest working on projects that require cross-team collaboration, particularly with user researchers, designers, product owners, web developers and business analysts. 
    I ask lots of questions and regularly present demos to clients and key stakeholders.

  <dt>User focused</dt>
  <dd>
    My communications experience has given me a passion for perfecting user experience, and championing inclusive design.
    I regularly take part in product research and co-design sessions with users, as I believe having a fuller understanding of user needs leads to a better technical solution.

  <dt>Rapid learner</dt>
  <dd>
    I learn new languages and technologies quickly. 
    At Cognizant I learnt Angular, .NET and Ionic for projects.
    At dxw, I have honed my testing practices using Playwright, mutation testing and axe-core to improve my tests.
    I taught myself Ruby and Rails before taking a 3 month boot camp with <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers</a> to learn software engineering best practices, and have picked up new tooling regularly throughout my marketing career and architecture education.

    I have a keen eye for design thanks to my background in architecture and design. I keep an open conversation with our UX teams to ensure consistent and usable design across our apps.

## Project experience

### dxw - Developer
January 2023-present

I develop server rendered applications in line with [dxw's technology principles](https://playbook.dxw.com/tech/development-and-technical-operations-team-principles/) which implement the GOV.UK design system and prioritise user needs, accessibility and maintainability.

- Delivering a new Application Programming Interface (API) to enable easier access to and analysis of [UK Parliament's Members' Register of Financial Interests](https://pds.blog.parliament.uk/2024/11/27/working-towards-a-fully-searchable-register-of-members-financial-interests/), as well as improved access for members of the public via the Parliament website.
- Launched the private beta of new internal product [Find information about academies and trusts](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/find-information-about-academies-and-trusts) for the Department of Education, which helped relieve the team reliance on legacy technology. The project achieved a high System Usability Score (SUS), received glowing feedback in an early accessibility audit and has since gone into public beta.
- Helped build and write content for dxw's first iteration of our [accessibility manual](https://accessibility.dxw.com/).

### Cognizant - Associate
September 2020-December 2023

Supporting the national roll-out of several key products for Network Rail as part of [Intelligent Infrastructure](https://www.networkrail.co.uk/running-the-railway/intelligent-infrastructure/)â€”a five-year transformation programme focused on providing maintenance teams the insight they need to predict and prevent faults before they cause delays.

- Full stack development on a new asset management tool for signalling relays. I led on frontend development, and took the opportunity to learn C# and .NET so that I could work across the Angular frontend application and ASP.NET Core API.
- Mobile development (Angular with Ionic) for a new application to support maintenance testing, moving from paper forms to a digital process.
- Led on designing the User Acceptance Testing phase for the rollout of new features with users.
- Presented regular live demonstrations of new features to client and key stakeholders.
