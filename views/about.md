description: I'm Liz, a web developer based in London. I have recently taught myself to code and like to spend my time perfecting user experience and accessibility.
---

My background is in the creative industry, as a marketeer for arts and design events. 
Increasingly, our events were reliant on our digital platforms, which is where I was able to hone my interest in web development.

I have worked with brilliant web development teams to create and refine event websites such as [Clerkenwell Design Week](https://www.clerkenwelldesignweek.com/), 100% Design and [Design Shanghai](https://www.designshanghai.com/)—working across a range of content management systems. 
Now I am using some of my previous experience to build engaging, user friendly products myself.

## Work

After completing a software engineering course at Makers Academy, I spent some time working as a frontend developer at [Cognizant](https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/services/digital-experience). 
Here, I contributed to Network Rail's transformative [Intelligent Infrastructure](https://www.networkrail.co.uk/running-the-railway/intelligent-infrastructure/)
programme, which is using data to help railway maintenance become proactive rather than reactive. 
I am now working at [dxw](https://www.dxw.com/), a digital agency creating public services that improve lives.

I have been building server-rendered web applications, as well as web components in Angular and React—and love writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript. 
I am an active champion for prioritising accessibility and usability in our solutions.

## Outside work

When I'm not coding you can find me outside, with my hiking boots on or [looking up](https://instagram.com/lookupdaily) at a great building.
