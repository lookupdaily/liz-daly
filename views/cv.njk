    <p>I am a polyglot and quick learner of languages and frameworks. I believe that simple, well-documented and maintainable code is more important than language specialism.</p>

          I am at my happiest working on projects that require cross-team collaboration, particularly with user researchers, designers, product owners, web developers and business analysts. 
          I ask lots of questions and regularly present demos to clients and key stakeholders.

          Whilst learning to code at Makers I rediscovered my love for a good diagram. You can find

          I have picked up the skills to learn new languages and technologies quickly. At Cognizant I have learnt Angular, .NET and Ionic for projects, and I have picked up new tooling regularly throughout my marketing career and architecture education. At dxw, I have honed my testing practices using Playwright, mutation testing and axe-core to improve my tests.

        I have a keen eye for design thanks to my background in architecture and design. I keep an open conversation with our UX teams to ensure consistent and usable design across our apps.
