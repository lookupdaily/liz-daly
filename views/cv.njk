    <p>I am a quick learner of languages and frameworks. I believe that simple, well-documented and maintainable code is more important than language specialism.</p>

        <dt>Collaborator</dt>
      <dd>
        I am at my happiest working on projects that require cross-team collaboration, particularly with user researchers, designers, product owners, web developers and business analysts. 
        I ask lots of questions and regularly present demos to clients and key stakeholders.

      <dt>User focused</dt>
      <dd>My communications experience has given me a passion for perfecting user experience, and championing inclusive design.</dd>
      
      <dt>Process driven</dt>
      <dd>
        Whilst learning to code at Makers I rediscovered my love for a good diagram. You can find 
        <a class="ld-link" href="https://github.com/lookupdaily/chitter-challenge">some examples of my approach</a> 
        to developing solutions in my READMEs. I prefer to develop using TDD.
      </dd>

      <dt>Rapid learner</dt>
      <dd>
        I have picked up the skills to learn new languages and technologies quickly. At Cognizant I have learnt Angular, .NET and Ionic for projects, and I have picked up new tooling regularly throughout my marketing career and architecture education. At dxw, I have honed my testing practices using Playwright, mutation testing and axe-core to improve my tests.
      </dd>
        
      <dt>Creative</dt>
      <dd>
        I have a keen eye for design thanks to my background in architecture and design. I keep an open conversation with our UX teams to ensure consistent and usable design across our apps.
