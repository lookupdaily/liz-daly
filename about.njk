<p>
  My background is in the creative industry, as a marketeer for arts and design events. 
  Increasingly, our events were reliant on our digital platforms, which is where I was able to hone my interest in web development.
</p>

<p>
  I have worked with brilliant web development teams to create and refine event websites such as 
  {{ link("Clerkenwell Design Week", "https://www.clerkenwelldesignweek.com/") }}, 
  100% Design and 
  {{ link("Design Shanghai", "https://www.designshanghai.com/")}}â€”working across a range of content management systems. 
  Now I am using some of my previous experience to build engaging, user friendly products myself.
</p>

<h2>Work</h2>

<p>
  After completing a software engineering course at Makers Academy, I spent some time working as a frontend developer at 
  {{ link("Cognizant", "https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/services/digital-experience") }}. 
  Here, I contributed to Network Rail's transformative 
  {{ link("Intelligent Infrastructure", "https://www.networkrail.co.uk/running-the-railway/intelligent-infrastructure/") }} 
  programme, which is using data to help railway maintenance become proactive rather than reactive. 
  I am now working at {{ link("dxw", "https://www.dxw.com/") }}, a digital agency creating public services that improve lives.
</p>

<p>
  I have been building applications and web components in Angular and React, and love writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript. 
  I am an active champion for prioritising accessibility and usability in our solutions.
</p>

<h2>Outside work</h2>

<p>
  When I'm not coding you can find me outside, with my hiking boots on or 
  {{ link("looking up", "https://instagram.com/lookupdaily") }} 
  at a great building.
